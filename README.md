# Lead Scoring Dataset

## Overview

The Lead Scoring Dataset is designed to help organizations and data scientists understand and develop models to score leads based on various features. Lead scoring is a critical process in sales and marketing to prioritize potential customers based on their likelihood of converting into paying customers. This dataset includes a variety of features that can be used to predict the lead score.

## Dataset Structure

The dataset consists of a single CSV file named `lead_scoring.csv`. Each row represents a unique lead with various attributes that may influence their lead score.

#### Columns:

1. **LeadID**: Unique identifier for each lead.
2. **FirstName**: First name of the lead.
3. **LastName**: Last name of the lead.
4. **Email**: Email address of the lead.
5. **PhoneNumber**: Phone number of the lead.
6. **LeadSource**: Source from which the lead was generated (e.g., Website, Referral, Social Media).
7. **LeadOrigin**: Origin of the lead (e.g., Landing Page Submission, API, Advertisement).
8. **DoNotEmail**: Indicates if the lead has opted out of email communications (Yes/No).
9. **DoNotCall**: Indicates if the lead has opted out of phone communications (Yes/No).
10. **Converted**: Indicates if the lead has been converted to a customer (0 for No, 1 for Yes).
11. **TotalVisits**: Total number of visits by the lead to the website.
12. **TotalTimeSpentOnWebsite**: Total time spent by the lead on the website (in seconds).
13. **PageViewsPerVisit**: Average number of page views per visit.
14. **LastActivity**: The last activity performed by the lead (e.g., Email Opened, Page Visited, Form Submitted).
15. **Country**: Country of the lead.
16. **Specialization**: The lead's area of specialization (e.g., IT, Marketing, Finance).
17. **HowDidYouHearAboutUs**: The medium through which the lead heard about the organization.
18. **WhatIsYourCurrentOccupation**: The lead's current occupation.
19. **WhatMattersMostToYouInChoosingAProduct**: The most important factor for the lead when choosing a product.
20. **Search**: Indicates if the lead used the search functionality on the website (Yes/No).
21. **Magazine**: Indicates if the lead subscribes to a magazine (Yes/No).
22. **NewspaperArticle**: Indicates if the lead came from a newspaper article (Yes/No).
23. **XyzCampaign**: Indicates if the lead is part of a specific XYZ campaign (Yes/No).
24. **LastNotableActivity**: The last notable activity performed by the lead (e.g., Email Opened, Page Visited).

## Usage

This dataset can be used for various purposes, including but not limited to:
- Building predictive models for lead scoring.
- Analyzing the effectiveness of different lead sources and origins.
- Identifying key factors that influence lead conversion.
- Developing marketing strategies to improve lead conversion rates.

### Example Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and manage categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the distribution of features, relationships between features, and identify patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may improve the predictive power of models.
4. **Model Building**: Develop and train machine learning models to predict the lead score or conversion probability.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
